In recent years, the world has seen an explosion in the amount of data being generated. Google proposed the MapReduce framework to allow programmers easily process massive amounts of data in parallel using a cluster of shared-nothing commodity machines. What started out as a tool for human efficiency subsequently began to be used as an intermediate representation for queries compiled from higher-level declarative languages. In this thesis, we present an alternate software stack for building scalable Big Data systems. We specifically focus on two parts of the stack. Hyracks is a new partitioned-parallel runtime layer that provides an efficient, generalized model for executing data-processing jobs on a cluster of commodity machines. Algebricks is a compiler framework that helps to build high-level declarative language compilers for parallel processing on top of Hyracks.
