@inproceedings{mapreduce,
    abstract = {MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify a \_map\_ function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a \_reduce\_ function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key. Many real world tasks are expressible in this model, as shown in the paper. <P> Programs written in this functional style are automatically parallelized and executed on a large cluster of commodity machines. The run-time system takes care of the details of partitioning the input data, scheduling the program's execution across a set of machines, handling machine failures, and managing the required inter- machine communication. This allows programmers without any experience with parallel and distributed systems to easily utilize the resources of a large distributed system. <P> Our implementation of MapReduce runs on a large cluster of commodity machines and is highly scalable: a typical MapReduce computation processes many terabytes of data on thousands of machines. Programmers find the system easy to use: hundreds of MapReduce programs have been implemented and upwards of one thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google's clusters every day. <P>},

@article{qoptpar,
    abstract = {The decreasing cost of computing makes it economically viable to reduce the response time of decision support queries by using parallel execution to exploit inexpensive resources. This goal poses the following query optimization problem: Minimize response time subject to constraints on throughput, which we motivate as the dual of the traditional DBMS problem. We address this novel problem in the context of Select-Project-Join queries by extending the execution space, cost model and search algorithm that are widely used in commercial DBMSs. We incorporate the sources and deterrents of parallelism in the traditional execution space. We show that a cost model can predict response time while accounting for the new aspects due to parallelism. We observe that the response time optimization metric violates a fundamental assumption in the dynamic programming algorithm that is the linchpin in the optimizers of most commercial DBMSs. We extend dynamic programming and show how optimization metrics which correctly predict response time may be designed.},

Parallel database products, e.g., Teradata, offer a solution, but are usually prohibitively expensive at this scale. Besides, many of the people who analyze this data are entrenched procedural programmers, who find the declarative, SQL style to be unnatural. The success of the more procedural  map-reduce  programming model, and its associated scalable implementations on commodity hardware, is evidence of the above. However, the map-reduce paradigm is too low-level and rigid, and leads to a great deal of custom user code that is hard to maintain, and reuse.},

@inproceedings{mapreduce,
    abstract = {MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify a \_map\_ function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a \_reduce\_ function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key. Many real world tasks are expressible in this model, as shown in the paper. <P> Programs written in this functional style are automatically parallelized and executed on a large cluster of commodity machines. The run-time system takes care of the details of partitioning the input data, scheduling the program's execution across a set of machines, handling machine failures, and managing the required inter- machine communication. This allows programmers without any experience with parallel and distributed systems to easily utilize the resources of a large distributed system. <P> Our implementation of MapReduce runs on a large cluster of commodity machines and is highly scalable: a typical MapReduce computation processes many terabytes of data on thousands of machines. Programmers find the system easy to use: hundreds of MapReduce programs have been implemented and upwards of one thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google's clusters every day. <P>},

    abstract = {The decreasing cost of computing makes it economically viable to reduce the response time of decision support queries by using parallel execution to exploit inexpensive resources. This goal poses the following query optimization problem: Minimize response time subject to constraints on throughput, which we motivate as the dual of the traditional DBMS problem. We address this novel problem in the context of Select-Project-Join queries by extending the execution space, cost model and search algorithm that are widely used in commercial DBMSs. We incorporate the sources and deterrents of parallelism in the traditional execution space. We show that a cost model can predict response time while accounting for the new aspects due to parallelism. We observe that the response time optimization metric violates a fundamental assumption in the dynamic programming algorithm that is the linchpin in the optimizers of most commercial DBMSs. We extend dynamic programming and show how optimization metrics which correctly predict response time may be designed.},

Parallel database products, e.g., Teradata, offer a solution, but are usually prohibitively expensive at this scale. Besides, many of the people who analyze this data are entrenched procedural programmers, who find the declarative, SQL style to be unnatural. The success of the more procedural  map-reduce  programming model, and its associated scalable implementations on commodity hardware, is evidence of the above. However, the map-reduce paradigm is too low-level and rigid, and leads to a great deal of custom user code that is hard to maintain, and reuse.},

	Abstract = {The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective matter, which depends on the readers interests, knowledge and attitudes. But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.},

@article{qoptpar,
	Abstract = {The decreasing cost of computing makes it economically viable to reduce the response time of decision support queries by using parallel execution to exploit inexpensive resources. This goal poses the following query optimization problem: Minimize response time subject to constraints on throughput, which we motivate as the dual of the traditional DBMS problem. We address this novel problem in the context of Select-Project-Join queries by extending the execution space, cost model and search algorithm that are widely used in commercial DBMSs. We incorporate the sources and deterrents of parallelism in the traditional execution space. We show that a cost model can predict response time while accounting for the new aspects due to parallelism. We observe that the response time optimization metric violates a fundamental assumption in the dynamic programming algorithm that is the linchpin in the optimizers of most commercial DBMSs. We extend dynamic programming and show how optimization metrics which correctly predict response time may be designed.},
